- [x] 5. Add sophisticated entrance animations
  - Implement staggered fade-in animations for page elements
  - Add subtle slide-up effects for content sections
  - Create smooth scale-in animations for interactive elements
  - Ensure animations respect prefers-reduced-motion settings
  - Optimize animation performance using transform and opacity
  - _Requirements: 3.2, 3.4, 6.4_

- [ ] 6. Enhance interactive element styling
  - Update button styles with red accent colors and hover effects
  - Add subtle glow effects and lift animations on hover
  - Improve input field styling to match the new theme
  - Implement smooth transitions for all interactive states

- [ ] 9. Implement error handling and fallbacks
  - Add robust error handling for logo loading failures
  - Implement graceful degradation for browsers without animation support
  - Create fallback styles for older browsers
  - Add performance monitoring to disable complex animations on low-end devices
  - Ensure the site works properly even if animations fail
  - _Requirements: 4.4, 4.5_

- [ ] 10. Conduct comprehensive testing and refinement
  - Test all existing functionality to ensure nothing is broken
  - Verify animations work smoothly across different browsers
  - Test responsive behavior on various devices and screen sizes
  - Validate accessibility compliance (screen readers, keyboard navigation, color contrast)
  - Perform performance testing to ensure fast load times
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5, 5.5, 6.5_

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Key Files to Modify

- `src/app/page.tsx` - Main homepage component integration
- `src/app/globals.css` - Color scheme and animation definitions
- `src/components/ui/logo-animation.tsx` - New logo animation component
- `src/components/header.tsx` - Minor adjustments if needed

### Animation Performance Considerations

- Use `transform` and `opacity` for GPU-accelerated animations
- Implement `will-change` property judiciously to optimize rendering
- Add `prefers-reduced-motion` media query support
- Consider using `requestAnimationFrame` for complex animations

### Color Palette Implementation

```css
:root {
  --bg-black: #000000;
  --logo-red: #dc2626;
  --logo-cream: #fef3c7;
  --accent-red: #ef4444;
  --text-primary: #ffffff;
  --text-secondary: #e5e7eb;
}
```

### Logo Animation Timing

- Dissolve In: 2 seconds
- Hold: 3 seconds
- Dissolve Out: 2 seconds
- Pause: 1 second
- Total Cycle: 8 seconds

### Responsive Breakpoints

- Mobile: < 640px
- Tablet: 640px - 1024px
- Desktop: > 1024px

## Success Criteria

Each task should result in:

1. **Maintained Functionality**: All existing features work exactly as before
2. **Visual Improvement**: Dramatic enhancement in professional appearance
3. **Smooth Performance**: Animations run at 60fps without janky behavior
4. **Responsive Design**: Perfect functionality across all device sizes
5. **Accessibility Compliance**: Meets WCAG guidelines for contrast and motion
6. **Cross-Browser Compatibility**: Works consistently across modern browsers

## Testing Checklist
