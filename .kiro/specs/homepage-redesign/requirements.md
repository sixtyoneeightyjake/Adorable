# Homepage Redesign Requirements

## Introduction

This project aims to transform the current homepage from a basic text-based interface to a polished, professional landing page that showcases the brand identity through the logo and creates an engaging user experience. The redesign will maintain all existing functionality while dramatically improving the visual appeal and user experience.
